Assumptions:

1. Ids can be between 100,000 and 3,100,00
2. Ages are 10...100
3. Unless stated otherwise, Female/Male ratio is 1:1
4. Age distribution for liver is a "flattened" normal distribution, mean=40, between 20-90
5. For part 1, I deliberately created 3 samples with no overlapping ids. Therefore the joined set size is the sum of all 3 separate ones. 
6. The samples are created for each cohort separately with only the fields relevant for each CSV file.
7. After the join, new data is created in the missing fields for overlap purposes.
8. The imputed new data has a different distribution (just for fun and possibly preperation for the bonus question)
9. Method data_sanity_tests checks and prints some of the data characteristics
